'''Given an array nums of n integers.



Return the length of the longest sequence of consecutive integers. The integers in this sequence can appear in any order.


Examples:
Input: nums = [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

Output: 4

Explanation:

The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [1, 2, 3, 4], which has a length of 4. This sequence can be formed regardless of the initial order of the elements in the array.

Input: nums = [0, 3, 7, 2, 5, 8, 4, 6, 0, 1]

Output: 9

Explanation:

The longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array is [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], which has a length of 9. 

Input: nums = [1, 9, 3, 10, 4, 20, 2]

Output:
4
Constraints:
     1 <= nums.length <= 105
     -109 <= nums[i] <= 109
Intuition
One simple approach is to look for sequences of consecutive numbers by utilising linear search in the array. For each number 洧논 in the array, we'll check if the next numbers like 洧논+1, 洧논+2, 洧논+3, and so on, are also in the array. This is like checking if we can build a chain of numbers that follow each other directly. By doing this for every number in the array, we can find the longest chain of consecutive numbers. Finally, we'll find the length of the longest chain among all the numbers in the array.

Approach
As you iterate through each number in the array, begin by checking if consecutive numbers like ( x+1, x+2, x+3 ), and so on, exist in the array. The occurrence of the next consecutive number can be checked by using linear search.
When you find consecutive numbers, start counting them using a counter. Increment this counter each time you find the next consecutive number in the sequence.
This counter effectively keeps track of how long the current consecutive sequence is as you move through the array and find more consecutive numbers.
Dry Run:-Please refer to the video for the dry-run.

Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(N3), where N is the size of the array.
In the worst case, all N elements form a single consecutive sequence. Each element in nums is checked in the outer loop O(N) times. The inner while loop could also run O(N) times for one outer iteration. Since linearSearch() is called inside the conditional statement of the while loop and itself runs in O(N), this results in a cubic time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(1), as we are not using any extra space to solve this problem.
